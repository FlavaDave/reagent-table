Reagent-table
=========

A table component with all the usual features you would expect.

- Sort rows by multiple columns
- Resizable columns
- Re-order columns
- Hide/show columns

Contrary to most React.js table components, this one uses the correct
HTML tags (table, thead, th, tr...) to be compatible with your
favorite CSS. This also means the data can easily be copied from the
table.



## Usage

Add this to your project dependencies:
[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/org.clojars.frozenlock/reagent-table/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/org.clojars.frozenlock/reagent-table)

Require Reagent-table in your namespace:
```clj
(ns my-ns
  (:require [reagent-table.core :as rt]))
```

Then, simply use it as a normal component:
```clj
[rt/reagent-table table-data config]
```

`table-data` is an atom containing a vector, each child being a row. How this data is rendered is determined by
the `:column-model` and `:render-cell` configuration elements. `config` is a map containing various
options described below.

There is a distinction between view and model coordinates for
column numbers. A column's view position may change if it is
reordered, whereas its model position will be that of its index
into `:column-model`

`:column-model` is a vector of so-called render-info maps containing
- `:header` A string for the header cell text
- `:key` The reagent key for the column position in any rows. If
absent defaults to the model index
- `:sortable false` When `:sort` is present (see below) by default all
columns are sortable. Otherwise any column can be excluded and no
glyph will appear in its header.
Other entries are as required by the client. The map is passed to
the `:render-cell` function when cells are painted.

`:render-cell` a function that returns the hiccup for a table cell
`(fn [render-info row row-num col-num] (...))`
where `render-info` is the column entry, `row` is the vector child from
`data-atom`, `row-num` is the row number and `col-num` is the column number
in model coordiates.

`:table-state` an atom used to hold table internal state. If supplied by
the client this is a way to see table state at the repl, and to allow the
client to modify column order and sorting state.

`:row-key` A function that returns a value to be used as the regaent key
for rows
`(fn [row row-num] (...))`
where `row` is the vector child from `data-atom`, `row-num` is the row number.

`:sort` a function to sort `data-atom` when a header cell sort arrow is clicked.
Returns the newly sorted vector. If absent, the table is not sortable and no
glyphs appear in the header.
`(fn [rows column-model sorting] (...))`
where `rows` is the vector to sort, `column-model` is the `:column-model` and `sorting`
is a vector of vectors of the form `[column-model-index :asc|:desc]`. If the
column-model entry includes `:sortable false` the individual column is excluded
from sorting. Select multiple columns for sorting by using ctrl-click. Repeat
to toggle the sort direction.

`:table` The attributes applied to the `[:table ... ]` element. Defaults
to `{:style {:width nil}}}`

`:thead` the attributes applied to `[:thead ...]`

`:tbody` the attributes applied to `[:tbody ...]`

`:caption` an optional hiccup form for a caption

`:column-selection` optional attributes to display visible column toggles
for example `{:ul {:li {:class "btn"}}}`

See `reagent-table.dev` for a working example.
