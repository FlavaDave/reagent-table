Contrarily to most React.js table components, this one use the correct
HTML tags (table, theader, th, tr...) to be compatible with your
favorite CSS. This also means the data can easily be copied from the
table.



## Usage

Add this to your project dependencies:
[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/org.clojars.frozenlock/reagent-table/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/org.clojars.frozenlock/reagent-table)

Require Reagent-table in your namespace:
```clj
(ns my-ns
  (:require [reagent-table.core :as rt]))
```

Then, simply use it as a normal component:
```clj
[rt/reagent-table table-data]
```

`table-data` can be raw data, or data in an atom. **If an atom is
provided, all manipulation will change the data directly inside the atom**.

(If it doesn't match how your atom is built, take a look at
[entanglement](https://github.com/Frozenlock/entanglement) to bridge
the two.)

The data must be a map containing at least the following two keys:
- `:headers`
- `:rows`


For example:
```clj
{:headers ["Row 1" "Row 2" "Row 3" "Row 4"]}
```

The cells could also be reagent component:
```clj
{:headers [[:span "Row 1"]
	       [:span "Row 2"]
		   [:span "Row 3"]
		   [:span "Row 4"]]}
```

`:rows` is similar, but should be a collection of rows, instead of a single row like `:headers`.

When using reagent components as cells, you can add the `:data`
metadata to each of them. This is the value that will be used when
sorting the columns.


See `reagent-table.dev` for a simple working example.


### Hide/Show Columns

To activate, set the value `:rows-selection` to non-nil in the
optional config argument.

### Table Caption

Set the value `:caption` to the text value or the component to be used
as the caption.
